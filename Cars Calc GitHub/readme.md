## 🧐 The Problem
Deciding between a Petrol, CNG, or EV car is confusing. Most calculators only check "Fuel Savings." They ignore **Opportunity Cost**—the interest you lose by paying a higher upfront cost for an EV/CNG car.

I built this tool to calculate the **Real Break-Even Point**, adjusted for:
* **Inflation (6%)**
* **Lost Investment Returns (SIP/FD)**
* **Maintenance Differences**
